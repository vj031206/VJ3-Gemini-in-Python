My Chosen Projects

Develop a web application using Flask or Django that performs sentiment analysis on user
entered text. The application should classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral using
TextBlob and display polarity and subjectivity scores.


Integrate Google Gemini in Python using the Google Generative AI API. Implement a system
that can remember conversation history, including previous user messages and responses.
Additionally, enable real-time data retrieval by integrating the Google Search API so the
model can answer real-time queries, such as the current price of Bitcoin or the weather in
Mumbai.


Create Speech to Image generation using monsterapi, that can take any language audio as
input and generate image based on speech.
